about: 
Hey guys, I currently play a character named Paulie Maltisanti and I’m trying to start a criminal family which is actually going very well and I really want to start a business which would be a Pizzeria to help further my RP and the criminal family RP. Is there anyway i could buy a business IC than customize it with an interior even if it is small. Also with that being said I know this isn’t easy work and it takes time to develop these things. If it would help to further this project, I have a few friends that have ran servers and actually have the files including a pizzeria with an interior. In conclusion, if this would be possible let me know what I have to do on my end and I’m sure we can figure something out and if not no worries at all. Have a good one!

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
No this feature im explaining is not related to a problem it's something i would like put into the server for RP reasons.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
There is many pizza places around Los santos but it seems weird just sitting in front of the pizza place with the other few members in my crew so far, it just doesnt seem very professional I guess. It would be nice to have some sort of interior maybe with a back room so we can have meetings instead of meeting in front of everyone or in some random place that doesnt really fit our characters. For example, I dont know if you have ever seen the sopranos but they always have "family" meetings in an italian restraunt funded by tony soprano but ran by his best friend from high school.

**Additional context**
I just wanna say I'm not really asking for anything too custom just a simple interior for a pizza place would be ideal. Also if you need help with anything on my end feel free to ask me my discord is GaretHough#3811 or you can find me as my nickname Paulie Maltisanti.
This link below is something im kind of looking for, even if i could buy that interior to be put in the server i would be more than happy to do so!
